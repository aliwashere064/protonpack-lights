# ProtonPack Lights
Lights for a proton pack - **WORK IN PROGRESS**

### Current Status
- **Cycletron lights** are working.
- **Power-up lights** are still a work in progress.

### Hardware Notes
This project uses an **ESP32-WROOM**, and the pin assignments are configured for that board. If you're using a different board, you may need to change the pin mappings in the code to match your hardware setup.

### DISCLAIMER
I canâ€™t guarantee it will work with other boards. If you plan to use a different board, be sure to check the pin configurations and adjust them accordingly.
